/// asynchronously disposed. Disposing the SerialDisposableAsync instance disposes the current disposable and prevents
/// further disposables from being set. This class is useful for scenarios where a resource needs to be replaced or
/// updated over time, ensuring that only one resource is active and properly disposed of at any given moment. All
