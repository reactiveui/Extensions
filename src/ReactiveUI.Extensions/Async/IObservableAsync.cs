/// <remarks>Use this interface to implement observable sequences that allow observers to subscribe asynchronously
/// and receive notifications in an asynchronous manner. This is useful for scenarios where subscription or
/// unsubscription may involve asynchronous operations, such as network or I/O-bound tasks. Implementations should
/// ensure that notifications are delivered according to the observer's contract and that resources are released when
/// the subscription is disposed.</remarks>

    /// wishes to receive notifications. Multiple observers may be subscribed concurrently.</remarks>
