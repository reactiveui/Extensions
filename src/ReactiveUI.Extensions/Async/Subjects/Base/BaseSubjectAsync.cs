/// completion notifications to multiple observers. It manages observer registration, notification, and completion in a
/// thread-safe manner. Derived classes should override the core notification methods to customize how observers are
/// notified asynchronously. The subject supports asynchronous subscription and notification patterns, making it
/// suitable for reactive and event-driven programming scenarios.</remarks>
