/// observers. Supports asynchronous notification, error handling, and completion signaling for observers subscribing to
/// the subject.

/// internal state between notifications. It manages observer subscriptions and provides extensibility points for
/// handling value notifications, error recovery, and completion events. Implementations should override the core
/// notification methods to define specific broadcasting or error-handling behaviors. Thread safety and observer
/// management are handled by the base class, allowing derived classes to focus on notification logic.</remarks>
