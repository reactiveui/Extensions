/// <remarks>An asynchronous subject enables push-based notification of values, errors, or completion events to
/// multiple observers. Observers can subscribe to the subject's values stream and receive notifications as they are
/// published. This interface is typically used in scenarios where asynchronous event propagation and coordination are
/// required, such as reactive programming or event-driven architectures.</remarks>
